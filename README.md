## 📊 Crypto Chatbot – Rule-Based Investment Advisor

Welcome to my first **rule-based chatbot**, built using **Python**!
This simple terminal-based bot gives **crypto investment advice** based on:

✅ **Profitability** (price trends, market cap)
🌱 **Sustainability** (energy use, project viability)

---

### 💻 How It Works

You type in the name of a cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Cardano), and the chatbot analyzes:

* 📈 **Price Trend**
* 💰 **Market Cap**
* ⚡ **Energy Use**
* ♻️ **Sustainability Score**

Based on this info, it gives advice like:

> “✅ Strong investment — profitable and sustainable.”

---

### ⚙️ Tech Used

* Python
* Rule-based logic (no ML or external APIs yet)

---

### 🚀 Try It Out

Clone the repo and run it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/crypto-chatbot.git
cd crypto-chatbot
python chatbot.py
```

---

### 🔖 Sample Interaction

```bash
Please ask me about anything crypto or type 'exit' to quit: Bitcoin

📊 Analysis for Bitcoin:
- Price Trend: rising
- Market Cap: high
- Energy Use: high
